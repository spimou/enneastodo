# To Do demo react app

created for Enneas 

## main packages

-redux , react redux
-mui
-react router dom

also uses local storage

## why react

since I am free to use a js framework, but justify my choice, I choose react because : 

-automates several ui parts and responsive design
-offers separation of concerns 
-has a component and a global state, making it easier to replace localstorage with an API and hydrate app with real data
-huge support , easy to fine solutions
-component-based architecture

## installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/spimou/enneastodo.git`
